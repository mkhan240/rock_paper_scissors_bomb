# rock_paper_scissors_bomb

This is a simple game of rock paper scissors that I have created using JavaScript.

How To Play:
1) The user needs to go to the function playGame()
2) In the parameter or in between the parenthesis the user needs to write one of this choices including the quotation mark: "rock", "paper" or "scissors" 
3) The code will randomly pick one of those choices for the computer
4) Depending who picks what, the winner will be determined
5) However if the user picks "bomb" then he or she will win in all combination!

Good Luck!
